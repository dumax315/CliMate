      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>CliMate is an interactive website for elementary schoolers to learn more about climate change and take small steps of action within their own communities! Fusing together engaging graphics with understandable lessons, we hope to educate the younger generation and empower them to fight for our future!

      <h1>Our Inspiration</h1>
      <p>When talking about the environment, there is a noticeable lack of environmental education for elementary schoolers. Often, people are afraid that introducing them to such an overwhelming topic will become unbearable or too burdening. However, educating them about current matters of the environment and the role they can play in mitigating the damage our planet faces can make all the difference for generations to come. Our team aims to equip younger students with the knowledge and action they need to advocate for the environment, especially as matters become more pressing. We aim to do this in an understandable and simplified way to promote localized advocacy in our younger generation. We believe that anyone of any age should be educated on climate change and what they can do to contribute to the fight for our planet’s livelihood. Our name embodies the idea that we serve as a buddy for kids as they learn and take action on the environment.
CliMate was inspired by two platforms, Quizlet and Khan Academy! Quizlet served as our inspiration in the knowledge aspect of the website. It incorporates features such as falling asteroids to make learning the notecard material more attention-grabbing. Khan Academy inspired our engaging UI/UX with badges and levels. Part of its rise as such a globally used education platform is the engaging rewards system it uses to incentivize students to continue learning. The action aspect of CliMate is inspired by the concept of bucket lists to accomplish long-term goals.

      <h1>Challenges We Ran Into</h1>
      <p>We faced a couple of changes in developing CliMate. 
In our initial development, we struggled to come up with an idea. We wanted to address an often overlooked gap, especially regarding the environment and Covid. However, we consistently called and eventually settled on our current idea. We were eager to flesh out all the features we could include, but ran into trouble in narrowing down our idea. We knew we were limited on time, so our first prototype couldn’t have everything we’d hoped. Despite this, across team discussion, we decided to focus on getting our Knowledge and Action pages done because those were the pillars of our initial idea. 
On a more technical note, we had a few errors, but managed to troubleshoot through them together. For instance, Firebase would only work with compiled front-end libraries, so we had to switch to Supabase for our user authentication and postgres database in our login page feature.
